# BOD-in-river-water
This data contains the Biochemical Oxygen Demand(BOD) description in river water of 7 stations. There are total 9 features with 147 observations. There is a target column named 'target' and name of the stations are given by columns 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7. Most of the observations in the dataset are missing. There are a total of 569 missing values which are treated by missing value imputation. Most of the observations are missing from columns 3,4,5,6 and 7 and thus these columns are removed from the data. From columns 1 and 2, there are 3 missing observations which are removed. The correlation between the columns is found using correlation matrix and heatmap. Various models are used to compare the accuracy of the output obtained by each of them. Models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGB Regressor are used to gain the accuracy from them. MAE, MSE, R2 and cross validation are used to compare the accuracy of outputs obtained from each model. Using these it was found that XGB Regressor gave better accuracy than other models that were used.
